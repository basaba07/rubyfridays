# Write a function that returns true if youngest_person() works correctly. 
# *Then*, write youngest_person() and check that it's correct using your test.
# youngest_person() should take an Array of people and return the youngest one.
#
# Hint: Consider using max or min, which are defined on the ruby docs site.
# http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html

def youngest_person(people)
  # ??? <-- Only do this after writing the test and making sure it starts out failing!
end

def test_youngest_person
  # ??? <-- Do this first!
end

# Sort an Array of people from oldest to youngest. Look up methods to help you out on Ruby docs.
def oldest_to_youngest(people)
